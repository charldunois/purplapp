Purplapp
========

[Purplapp](http://app.net/purplapp) is an app.net web statistics application.

### Features

Find them in our [features.md file](https://github.com/purplapp/purplapp/blob/master/features.md). :)

### Configuration

Put it on a server with PHP. :)

However, you will need to rename config.default.php file to config.php and include an access token:

```
<?php
define('ACCESS_TOKEN', 'ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE');
?>
```

Make sure you don't share this access token with anyone. You can get an access token from [@duerig's Dev Lite](http://dev-lite.jonathonduerig.com).
