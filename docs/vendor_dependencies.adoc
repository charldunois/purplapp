Vendor dependencies are numerous and hard to manage in a web application.
Here's how Purplapp's are organized:

PHP dependencies
----------------
All PHP dependencies are installed and managed via
https://getcomposer.org[Composer]. `composer.json`, `composer.lock`, `vendor/`,
and `bin/` are all a part of that process.

NPM dependencies
----------------
Building the project's assets is handled by Gulp. `package.json`,
`gulpfile.json`, and `node_modules/` are all a part of that process.

Front-end dependencies
----------------------
Dependencies like jQuery and Bootstrap are managed by bower. `bower.json` and
`bower_components/` are a part of that process.
